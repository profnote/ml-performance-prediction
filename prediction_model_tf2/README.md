# ML performance prediction

### Data generation
1. In *Generate_train_data* the code to generate benchmarks for convolutional and fully connected layers with random parameters can be found. The scripts will create .pkl files in the *Generate_train_data/results* folder.  
You can then move them to *data* for data preprocessing.

### Model training
2. The data generated by the program described above is to build a feed-forward model for predicting compute times for convolutions and fully connected layers.  
3. The data is preprocessed using the jupyter notebooks in *notebooks/prepare_train_data*. Use *merge_data-all.ipynb* to prepare data from multiple GPUs.
4. The model can be trained using the jupyter notebook *notebooks/model_compTime.ipynb*, and will be saved in the *models* folder.

The resulting model can be used to infer the performance of a wide range of deep learning models on different hardware. Install the python package from https://github.com/CDECatapult/mlpredict for a full pipeline.
